        Road maps would work well in a force layout because intersections would
        be represented by nodes and the rodes would be the edges connecting those
        intersections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Family trees could also be done well using force layouts. Each family member would
        be a node with their relationships to the other people, the edges.

        It would also be good for viewing a friendship web.
        It would offer insights into which of each nodes friends are friends and how
        closely people are. Each person would be a node, with their edges being their friends.
